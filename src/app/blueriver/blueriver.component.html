<p id="riverbio">The Blue River begins near Breckenridge and flows north to Kremmling where it meets the Colorado River. 
    Along its path it enters and exits Dillon Reservoir and Green Mountain Reservoir. The Blue River is usually divided into three sections:
     the upper river above Dillon Reservoir, the middle section between Dillon and Green Mountain Reservoir, 
     and the lower section below Green Mountain Reservoir north to Kremmling. The upper river is a small stream with plenty of public access around Breckenridge. 
     There is a decent population of small to medium sized brown and rainbow trout, and some brook trout near the headwaters south of Breckenridge.
     <br><br>Most anglers are drawn to the middle and lower river, however. The tailwater below Dillon Reservoir runs directly through Silverthorne. 
     It has suffered from inconsistent flows coming out of Dillon Dam and a lack of aquatic insects partly due to the very cold water coming from the bottom 
     of Dillon Dam year round. There is very little natural reproduction in the Blue River around Silverthorne. This section is stocked heavily with some 
     large rainbows in the 16-24" range every year, usually during the winter months.<br><br>

     The Blue River below Green Mountain Reservoir is the second tailwater section of the Blue River. The bug life
     is much better in this section of the river. There is a strong population of wild rainbow and brown trout from the dam down 
     to the confluence with the Colorado River. Trout exceeding 20 inches are common. Public access is limited and many anglers float through the private stretches by 
     putting in at the public access below Green Mountain Reservoir, which extends for about three miles. Private land owners have stocked and fed their own trout for 
     years and have grown some very large fish. There is also some public access below the initial three miles around and between the private
     water, so anglers should be careful not to trespass. This section of the Blue can be very productive for anglers both wading and floating.
