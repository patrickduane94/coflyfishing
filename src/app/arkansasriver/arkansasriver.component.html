<p id="riverbio">The Arkansas River spans over 1,400 miles before meeting the Mississippi River and is the sixth longest river in the US. The river begins near the town of Leadville
    and holds trout from the headwaters downstream for well over 100 miles through the Pueblo tailwater. The upper river around Leadville is a winding meadow stream with a good mix of riffles, 
    runs, and pools. Public access is plentiful on the Arkansas River. Further downstream the river gradually becomes wider and the trout are a bit bigger. Between Buena Vista and Coaldale is considered
    the best stretch of the upper Arkansas. The river runs through a series of gorges and canyons such as Brown's Canyon just downstream of Buena Vista and the Royal Gorge near Canon City. 
    The Arkansas is primarily a wild brown trout fishery until the Pueblo tailwater. The river can hold up to 5,000 trout per mile. A whirling disease resistant strain of rainbow trout has
    been stocked for the purpose of developing a wild population of rainbow trout in the upper river above Pueblo Reservoir.<br><br>
    Below Pueblo Reservoir the Arkansas River is much slower with some very deep holes. It holds mostly rainbow trout and a small population of brown trout. There is little to no natural reproduction here so 
    these trout populations are maintained through heavy stocking of 3" sub-catchable trout which grow in the river. Some warmwater species such as smallmouth bass, carp, and walleye
    are present here and are occasionally caught. This tailwater section of the Arkansas is a high quality fishery but can get very crowded due to the ease of access and usually mild temperatures, even 
    throughout the winter.<br><br>
